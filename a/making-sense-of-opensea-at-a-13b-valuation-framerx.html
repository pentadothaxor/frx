        <h1>Making sense of OpenSea at a $13B valuation</h1>

        <p>OpenSea, the well-known NFT marketplace, has raised a $300 million round at a $13.3 billion valuation. Newcomer broke the news yesterday before the company confirmed the transaction.</p><p>For critics of the present-day cryptoeconomy and NFT market, the round was perhaps more evidence of how overheated things have become. After all, OpenSea last raised at a fraction of its new valuation under a year ago, adding $100 million to its accounts at a $1.5 billion valuation in July.</p><p>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </p><p>Read it every morning on FramerX+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.</p><p>That sort of valuation appreciation must indicate prohibitive speculation among the investing classes, right? Well, let’s find out.</p><p>OpenSea is a pretty straightforward business to understand. As I wrote over my winter vacation, the company takes a 2.5% cut of transactions on its service. That means we can track its aggregate trading volume and come up with ballpark estimates for its scale.</p><p>Can we get precise? Nope. Can we learn enough to better understand why OpenSea managed to command such a huge check and towering valuation? Yes, I think so.</p><p>I want to figure out how the new OpenSea valuation squares up with its revenues. From there, we’ll ask if the company feels underpriced or overpriced. This will be a fun journey of collecting data and executing minor math magic. Let’s do some thinking!</p><p>The simplest way to get a handle on the scale of OpenSea is to simply check its trailing 30-day trading volume and apply its 2.5% take rate to the sum. Per crypto data source Dappradar, OpenSea saw $2.91 billion in trading volume in the last 30 days. That works out to an anticipated gross haul from OpenSea of $72.75 million.</p><p>That’s a month, mind. If we took that single period and multiplied it to generate a yearly run-rate figure, OpenSea would be on pace to see $34.92 billion in volume, generating gross revenues of $873 million over 12 months.</p><p>There are other ways to get our hands on the company’s scale. Data from Dune Analytics collected by @rchen8 has more granular historical data to parse. Per Dune, OpenSea saw trading volume of $3.25 billion in December, $2.37 billion in November and $2.64 billion in October. Combined, those figures work out to $8.26 billion in volume, a 2.5% cut of which would be worth $206.5 million.</p><p>If we extrapolate that final number to a full-year tally, it would shake out to a yearly run rate of $826 million. That’s pretty close to our first number of a yearly run-rate estimate of $873 million for OpenSea’s gross revenues, provided that the company’s flat-percentage costs execute in-market as we anticipate.</p><p>Let’s use a yearly run rate of $850 million for the company because it’s in between our two estimates for the company’s recent revenue pace, extrapolated to a full-year tally. At a $13.3 billion valuation, OpenSea is only worth 15.6x its present-day run rate. That’s very not insane for today’s market.</p><p></p>
