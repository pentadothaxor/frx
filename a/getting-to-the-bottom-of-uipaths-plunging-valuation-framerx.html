        <h1>Getting to the bottom of UiPath’s plunging valuation</h1>
        <img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1232881690.jpg?w=600" alt="Getting to the bottom of UiPath’s plunging valuation – FramerX" />
        <p>Just over a year ago, UiPath was among the most favored startups in the world. Last February the company raised a massive $750 million round at a staggering $35 billion valuation. The robotic process automation, or RPA company, was firing on all cylinders.</p><p>By the time that UiPath went public in April of last year, its final private price looked a bit, well, pricey. The company’s early IPO price range was underneath its last valuation, but after raising that range and pricing above it, the unicorn was still valued at a modest deficit to that $35 billion figure.</p><p>During its first day’s trading however, the company managed to crest the price set by its round worth three-quarters of a billion dollars. FramerX chatted with the company’s CFO about its method of going public at that time, and the timing of its debut for more context; the executive praised the ability to attract new investors in a traditional offering, instead of the more trendy direct listing option.</p><p>UiPath’s value shot to as much as $90 per share, pushing its valuation to around $43 billion per YCharts data.</p><p>Since then, however, things have gone poorly for UiPath, at least in valuation terms. The company was down over 3% at $18.29 per share on Friday afternoon, bringing its valuation under $10 billion. From red-hot unicorn to uneven IPO, to strong early trading, to a painful descent — what went wrong with UiPath?</p><p>FramerX has two hypotheses: The first being that the company simply got caught up in a broad repricing of technology revenues by public-market investors; this is not a new story, and if it explains the UiPath valuation declines would put the technology concern in good company. However, there could also be a technology-related explanation at play, as well. And, of course, both factors could be at play at once.</p><p>To understand what may have happened with UiPath’s disappearing valuation, let’s first talk numbers and then riff on the tech side of the coin!</p><p>UiPath remains a company on the move. In the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2022 — in English, the three months ending January 31, 2022 — the RPA market leader reported revenues of $289.7 million in total revenue and a quarter-ending annual recurring revenue (ARR) figure of $925.3 million. From those data points you can see how the public markets have changed their mind about the value of software revenue.</p><p></p>
