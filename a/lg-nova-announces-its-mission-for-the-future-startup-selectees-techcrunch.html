        <p>In January, I got under the skin of LG Nova — electronics and appliances giant LG’s internal startup incubator — and its search for a different way of doing a corporate accelerator. Today, NOVA (short for North American Innovation Center) is announcing the 20 startups it selected as part of its Mission for the Future global challenge competition. The companies represent new developments in the areas of Connected Health, Energizing Mobility, Smart Lifestyle, the Metaverse and “Innovation for Impact,” which the company describes as a general “socially impactful” tech category.</p><p>Each of these 20 companies will receive $100,000 each to work with LG to create a business framework for running a pilot with LG’s accelerator.</p><p>“Over the last few months, our work with the First 50 startups has helped us continue to refine our vision for the future as we look at new areas of growth for LG,” LG Electronics Senior VP for Innovation Dr. Sokwoo Rhee, who I also interviewed in January, said in an email. “We’re inspired by all of those who have participated to date with groundbreaking, thoughtful tech innovations to drive and contribute to our collaborative community and guiding principle of ‘outside-in’ innovation. With this announcement, we’re sharing the results of our ongoing work in engaging with the startup and entrepreneur community to create impactful technologies that will lead society into the future.”</p><p>LG and the hunt for the next-gen corporate incubator</p><p></p><p>Moving forward to the next phase in the areas of “Smart Lifestyles and Innovation for Impact,” LG Nova selected companies that “represent different aspects of people’s changing priorities on simplifying life and living better with personalized services”:</p><p>In the Connected Health space, the center of innovation is shifting to patient-focused care and wellness, quickened by the pace of new technology adoption in healthcare over the past two years. With the focus on developing an advanced technology platform for providing services, LG Nova selected:</p><p>In the XR category, LG Nova picked a trio of companies that offer “effective alternatives to health and wellness services” for patients through XR/VR/AR environments.</p><p>Psychedelic VR meditation startup Tripp raises $11 million Series A</p><p></p><p>In the Metaverse space, LG is pursuing a variety of applications with the intent to drive broader adoption of new immersive, interactive technologies and create greater business opportunities. Selectees:</p><p>Lastly, LG’s “Energizing Mobility” category focuses on the electric mobility sector and EV charging infrastructure ecosystem, paramount to achieving a more sustainable future:</p><p>Is EV charging the next gig for the gig economy? SparkCharge thinks so</p><p></p><p>I-EMS Group, Ltd. uses AI and blockchain to enable power optimization across smart cities, smart homes and e-mobility. Kardome’s AI-driven speech-clustering technology optimizes speech for vehicle interfaces playing an important role in the move toward advanced AI systems in the car. Faction has a unique approach to driverless technology and light electric vehicles that introduces a more efficient way to move goods and people.</p><p>LG claims that the top 20 companies were culled from a group of more than 1,300 applicants.</p>
