        <p>In 2021, more than $329.5 billion was invested in startups across all stages, per Crunchbase. And a significant majority of that funding was spent on only one aspect: Growth.</p><p>I have worked in a wide spectrum of growth roles, ranging from a startup with Series A funding to the 30,000-employee Uber. I’ve witnessed every growth role imaginable, as well as their daily functions, expertise areas and scope.</p><p>These experiences have provided me with a solid understanding of how and when startups should hire in their early days.</p><p>Let’s start by outlining the growth verticals most commonly found today.</p><p></p><p>Common growth verticals. Image Credits: Jonathan Martinez</p><p></p><p>Nearly every startup will eventually need helping hands with each of the growth verticals above.</p><p>Paid acquisition employees are responsible for managing and optimizing paid social channels (Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat) and search channels (Google, ASA).</p><p>Lifecycle requires the conversion of recipients of email, push and text communications into users. Organic refers to the overall management of non-paid mediums, such as social media and SEO.</p><p>Affiliate marketers form incentive-driven relationships with entities that have large or niche audiences. OOH covers offline media activities, such as direct mail and billboard advertisements.</p><p>Finally, influencer marketers are specialists in forming relationships and leveraging content creators to scale a business.</p><p>These are the most common growth roles, but you’ll find other growth specialties too, including for products, operations, streaming TV and podcasts.</p><p>Once you’ve nailed down the type of growth hire you need, you must ensure that their resume doesn’t do all the talking. A few key principles that any growth specialist should know and be questioned on in interviews include:</p><p>It’s also a good idea to ask them questions outside of their specialty to understand how they think about growth. Do they have a broad understanding of growth marketing and how to scale a startup? It’s critical to ensure they posses a deep and broad understanding of some of the topics, such as incrementality and how testing will impact the allocation of efforts. The list above isn’t exhaustive by any means; merely one you can draw inspiration from.</p>
