        <h1>It’s correction time for Latin American VC activity</h1>
        <img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-BLU.jpg?w=533" alt="It’s correction time for Latin American VC activity – FramerX" />
        <p>Latin America appears set to chalk up another quarter of falling venture capital activity, adding to a string of successive periods when the value of investments in the region fell.</p><p>Leaning on PitchBook data and looking at venture-backed companies in Central and South America, a FramerX analysis indicates that investment volume in deal and dollar terms is set to decline in Q2 2022. With a few weeks of data left to collect as June continues, the picture may shift, but it would require a simply incredible run of closed deals to halt the now-regular decline in venture capital investment in Latin America.</p><p>This does not mean that deals are not still happening; they are. And falling venture capital interest does not mean that Latin America’s promise as a startup hub failed to materialize; huge companies have been scaled there and taken public. And we are not working today to imply that any particular region won’t prove a hotbed of startup activity and technological innovation more generally, in time. Instead, we’re just looking at the latest ticks in the tape to see where investment is flowing — and slowing — today.</p><p>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </p><p>Read it every morning on FramerX+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.</p><p>Signs of softening in the Latin American startup market abound. Not merely in aggregate datasets, something we’ll get to in a minute. Even the region’s more impressive recent rounds have a touch of sponginess to them. For example, Ecuadorian fintech Kushki recently raised what it called an extension to its Series B. Naturally, it’s a little bit hard to call a $100 million round an early-stage extension, but in prior climes, we suspect that the funding event would have been a natural Series C with new participants, instead of a Series C from repeat investors with a “Series B extension” label slapped on top.</p><p>After posting quarters of falling venture capital investment, Latin America has turned the corner and is now trending toward quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year declines in Q2 2022 VC activity. The correction has arrived in the region.</p><p>For reference, recall that globally, through the first quarter, global venture capital activity was up on a year-over-year basis. We have yet to parse total market data for the part of the second quarter we’ve already consumed, but if Latin America is a leading indicator, the signs are not positive.</p><p>Let’s dig into the early data and then discuss the halo effect — or lack thereof — of Latin American giants like Nubank, as well as some regional matters that could complicate the region’s startups’ access to venture capital.</p><p>Let’s start with caveats. We are working with an early dataset, which means we’re not looking at a full picture. Instead, we’re hunting for directional trends to better understand Latin America, while not getting too hung up on particular data points. The data will change.</p><p></p>
