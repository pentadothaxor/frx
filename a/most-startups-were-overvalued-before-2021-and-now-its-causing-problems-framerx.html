        <p>Under normal circumstances, the higher the valuation of a startup, the better it is for all stakeholders involved. High valuations indicate success and the potential of a business; they attract new customers and new talent; they build a reputation.</p><p>And, provided a company’s valuation continues to increase, everyone will benefit.</p><p>As such, founders and investors have always been incentivized to believe in optimistic estimates of a company’s true worth.</p><p>Post-money valuations were inflated by market expectations in 2021, but they were also inflated by the underlying mechanics of the valuation model itself.</p><p>In order to navigate the impending challenges of a normalizing market, founders need to understand the impact of both levers.</p><p>	</p><p></p><p>For founders, employees and VCs alike, 2021 must’ve seemed like a miracle year. The initial caution that gripped hearts at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic had faded, valuations were rising and funding was once again flowing freely.</p><p>VC investment volume nearly doubled to $643 billion in 2021, up from $335 billion a year ago. Last year also saw 586 new unicorns compared to 167 in 2020 and 1,033 IPOs in the U.S. versus 471 a year earlier.</p><p>However, as the transition from 2020 to 2021 showed us, things can change rapidly.</p><p>In 2022, public tech companies’ share prices and market caps are in sharp decline due to rising interest rates, geopolitical developments and normalizing technology conditions. In a normalizing market like this one, once-inflated valuations can become a big problem, particularly for founders, employees and early investors.</p><p>To understand why inflated valuations are an issue, we need to first look at one of the underlying mechanics at work.</p><p>Unlike publicly listed companies, whose valuations are constantly rising and falling, the valuation of a startup will typically only change after the close of a new funding round. The calculation for the startup’s new value is fairly straightforward:</p><p>New valuation = (share price at latest round) x (total number of company shares)</p><p>This is known as the post-money valuation model and is commonly accepted as the industry standard.</p>
