        <p>My work in early-stage startups focused on operations, so I used Wikipedia to find the formula for calculating a company’s post-money valuation:</p><p>PMV = N x P</p><p>So, if a company offers a round with 10 million shares and one investor pays $10 million for 1 million shares, that startup now has a post-money valuation of $100 million.</p><p>But, to invoke the Norse god of thunder: Is it though?</p><p>According to Bastian Hasslinger, an investor at Picus Capital, the ongoing market correction sending a shockwave through the tech industry isn’t just the result of overinflated expectations.</p><p>Full FramerX+ articles are only available to members.
Use discount code TCPLUSROUNDUP to save 20% off a one- or two-year subscription.</p><p>All startups are overvalued because “not all shares are equal,” he writes. Different investor classes enjoy varying levels of downside protection, and as a result, “the model often implicitly overstates the true value of the company, even if the share price paid by the investor is fair.”</p><p>Hasslinger describes the current moment as a “normalizing market,” which means the people who have the most to lose in terms of equity are startup employees, founders and investors who didn’t buy into premium share classes.</p><p>If you work at a startup, this post is highly recommended reading: It’s a succinct explainer that will help you better understand the market forces currently driving down your company’s valuation.</p><p>And remember: All valuations are hypothetical, so bear that in mind the next time you’re reviewing an offer letter.</p><p>Thanks very much for reading,</p><p>Walter Thompson
